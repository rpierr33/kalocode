# Setup Instructions for Firebase and Stripe Configuration

## Introduction

To ensure the smooth operation of the application, you will need to configure both **Firebase** for user authentication and data management, and **Stripe** for payment processing. This guide will walk you through setting up the required environment variables on both the client and server sides.

---

## Client-Side Configuration (React)

The client application uses Firebase for authentication and data storage. You need to add your Firebase configuration in a `.env` file located in the root of your React project.

### Step 1: Create `.env` File

In the root directory of your React project, create a `.env` file (if it doesn't exist).

### Step 2: Add Firebase Configuration to `.env` File

Add the following Firebase credentials in your `.env` file. Replace the placeholder values with your actual Firebase credentials:

```plaintext
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_API_KEY=YOUR_FIREBASE_API_KEY_HERE
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=YOUR_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN_HERE
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=YOUR_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID_HERE
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=YOUR_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET_HERE
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=YOUR_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID_HERE
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_APP_ID=YOUR_FIREBASE_APP_ID_HERE
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_MEASUREMENT_ID=YOUR_FIREBASE_MEASUREMENT_ID_HERE
```
````

### Step 3: Install Firebase SDK

To interact with Firebase, you need to install the Firebase SDK:

```bash
npm install firebase
```

### Step 4: Get Firebase Credentials

1. **Go to Firebase Console:** [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/)
2. **Create a New Project** or select an existing one.
3. **Go to Project Settings** (gear icon) > "Project Settings".
4. **Find your Firebase SDK snippet** under the "General" tab.
5. Copy the credentials and paste them into your `.env` file.

## Server-Side Configuration (Stripe)

On the server side, you'll use Stripe to handle payments. You need to configure Stripe by adding the API keys to your `.env` file in the server directory.

### Step 1: Create `.env` File

In the root of your server project, create a `.env` file (if it doesn't exist).

### Step 2: Add Stripe Configuration to `.env` File

Add the following Stripe keys to your `.env` file. Replace the placeholders with your actual Stripe credentials:

```plaintext
STATIC_DIR="../client"
STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY="pk_test_xxx"
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY="sk_test_xxx"
```

### Step 3: Install Stripe SDK

To interact with Stripe, you need to install the Stripe SDK on your server:

```bash
npm install stripe
```

### Step 4: Get Stripe Credentials

1. **Go to the Stripe Dashboard:** [Stripe Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/)
2. **Find your API Keys:** In the "Developers" section of the dashboard, click on "API keys". Copy both the **Publishable Key** and **Secret Key**.
3. Add them to your server's `.env` file as shown above.

## Important Notes

- **Security:** Never expose your **Stripe Secret Key** or Firebase API keys in client-side code. Always store sensitive keys in environment variables (like `.env` files).
- **Environment-specific Configuration:** Ensure the `.env` files for both the client and server are properly set up before deploying to production. Use different credentials for development and production environments.
- **Restart Servers:** After modifying the `.env` files, make sure to restart both your client and server to apply the changes.

## Conclusion

With the Firebase and Stripe keys correctly configured, your application will be able to authenticate users, manage data securely, and process payments. Make sure to replace the placeholders with your actual credentials to ensure everything works correctly.

```

### Instructions:
1. Replace the placeholders in the `.env` files with the actual keys you get from Firebase and Stripe.
2. Follow the steps in the README to ensure proper configuration of both Firebase and Stripe in your project.
3. Keep your `.env` files secret by adding them to `.gitignore` to avoid accidentally pushing them to version control.
```
